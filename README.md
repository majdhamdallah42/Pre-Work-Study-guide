# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This prework study guide was created for students taking the UCLA coding bootcamp. I created this guide so that students can understand the fundementals of using The Visual Studio Code's development enviromnet. This project is a basic HTML webpage, that utilizes Javascript, CSS, HTML, and GIT.

## Usage

To make use of this preliminary study guide, go through the notes within each section. For recommendations on where to begin your studies, you can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command + Option + I on Mac, or Control + Shift + I on Windows. This will unveil a console panel positioned either below or beside the web page in your browser. Within this panel, you'll find a compilation of subjects covered in the pre-work.
